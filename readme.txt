This project is broken into two files: the landing page we used to pitch ShopLyft and the actual
Java Platform.

To run the java program, use a basic IDE that doesn't require a nested file structure with a src folder. We used Code::Blocks.

Used Java 7 to compile. To run the program, run the test class.
