This was our project for the hackathon: BattleHacks. Won a sponsor prize and honourable mention.
We built a wireless grocery cart scanner using NFC technology. The idea being that the smart grocery cart can keep track of every item placed inside of it because they are tagged with NFC chips. The item's price and other information is then added to the cart and checking out is as easy as tap and go with PayPal. We can foresee real-world applications with this program.



This project is broken into two files: the landing page we used to pitch ShopLyft and the actual
Java Platform.

To run the java program, use a basic IDE that doesn't require a nested file structure with a src folder. We used Code::Blocks.

Used Java 7 to compile. To run the program, run the test class.
